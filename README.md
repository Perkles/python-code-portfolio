# :wave: Welcome to my Python code portfolio

[:brazil:](https://github.com/Perkles/python-code-portfolio/tree/master/pt-br)

Getting to know how much a developer knows about technology can be complicated. To make the recruiter's life easier I create this repository.

Here you'll find all the Python projects I've created and **how** each one contributed to building my knowledge base as a developer.

This repository is for technical recruiters. You can find broader information about me, including open source contributions, personal projects, and more on my [website](https://perkles.github.io/).

## Web Development

This project is a personal blog generator made with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Each user has a page where he/she can write blog entries, update, delete, and publish. Users can have access to other user's entries on the home page as long as visiting other user's profiles. Read the specific concepts applied in this project [here](https://github.com/Perkles/a-django-blog).
